# Fun Python Programs
## Description
A fun collection of random python programs I've written to explore ideas or concepts that cross my mind.

## Why?
Inspired by a reddit thread I read about random interview questions, I decided to create a log of sorts in this repo as a collection of fun and simple programming ideas. 

## Programs
### Elevator
A multithreaded elevator program to simulate the movement of an elevator in response to sporadic requests for transportation along floors. 
### Shopping
A command line implementation of a shopping cart with essential features such as adding/removing.
